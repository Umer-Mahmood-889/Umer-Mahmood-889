# 👋 Hi, I’m Umer Mahmood  

- 👀 I’m passionate about software development — the closer it gets to the hardware, the more excited I am.  
- 🔥 I also enjoy higher-level development when it’s related to IoT, such as building cross-platform mobile apps (Xamarin/.NET MAUI) or desktop tools for production and configuration of embedded devices.  
- 🌱 My comfort zone includes **C, C#, and Python**. I’m currently learning **ML.NET**, and I plan to explore **Rust** and **Ruby** in the future.  
- 💞️ I’m always open to collaborating on **embedded projects** and **IoT-focused mobile app development**.  
- 📫 Reach me at: **umermahmood518@gmail.com**
